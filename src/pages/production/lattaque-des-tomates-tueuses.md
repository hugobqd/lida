  The finished film contains footage of a real helicopter crash. In a scene
  showing law enforcement officers firing their weapons to ward off tomatoes in
  a field, a $60,000 [Hiller
  Aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiller_Aircraft "Hiller Aircraft")
  UH-12E that had been rented for the production was supposed to have landed in
  the tomato patch behind the officers, but during the landing, its tail rotor
  struck the ground, causing the craft to spin out of control near the ground,
  roll over, and burst into flames. 


  The helicopter pilot escaped without serious injury.

description: The film opens with a scroll saying that when Alfred Hitchcock's
  film *The Birds (1963)* was released, audiences laughed at the notion of birds
  revolting against humanity, but when an attack perpetrated by birds occurred
  in 1975, no one laughed. This is followed by a pre credits sequence of a
  tomato rising out of a woman's garbage disposal. Her *puzzlement* turns into
  terror as the tomato draws her into a corner. Following the credits, the
  police investigate her death. One officer discovers that the red substance
  with which she is covered is not blood, **but tomato juice**.
